  <p>Hi, <strong> I'm Ashley </strong>! I'm a sophomore at the University of Kentucky! I'm majoring in ICT and minoring in creative writing. 
  I'm from Hurricane, West Virginia. (If you stop by make sure to hit Tudor's Biscuit World.) I love reading, writing, film, TV, video games, and comic books! My favorite comic series are <i> Sandman </i> by Neil Gaiman and <i> Hawkeye </i> by Matt Fraction. My favorite DC properties are Batman and the Birds of Prey while my favorite Marvel ones are the X-Men and Spider-Man. 
  My other interests include working with children, Dungeons and Dragons, and Shakespeare. I'm an introverted person but even though I'm quiet, I'm still always passionate about what I'm doing. I hope we all have a good semester! </p>
